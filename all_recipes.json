    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C) and bring a pot of water (enough to cover the bell peppers) to a boil.\n\n2. Wash the bell peppers, cut off the tops, and scoop out the insides. If needed, slice a small part off the bottom of the peppers so they will stand upright. (NOTE: Chop the extra bell pepper tops to cook later with the onion - discard the stem.)\n\n3. Blanch the bell peppers for 5 minutes to slightly soften. (Alternative, you can roast the peppers for 20 minutes to soften).\n\n4. Set the softened peppers into a lightly oiled baking dish.\n\n5. Heat the oil in a large pan to medium heat and add the onions, chopped pepper tops, and jalapeno (if using). Cook for 5 minutes to soften.\n\n6. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute, or until the garlic becomes fragrant.\n\n7. Add the ground beef and cook 5-6 minutes, breaking apart as you go, until cooked through.\n\n8. Add the fire roasted tomatoes, seasonings, and cooked rice. Stir together and remove from heat.\n\n9. Stir in half of the shredded cheese until incorporated."

Then put the cheese in a cheese cloth and squeeze and twist out all the moisture. Rinse the outside of the cloth, squeeze again, then open the cloth to get the cottage cheese out. \n\n** Other recipes say you can use a full egg in the cottage cheese mix. Use 3/4 to 1 cup of cottage cheese, 3 TBSP sugar, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.\n\n** Some recipes suggest 1/2 tsp. baking powder.\n\n** Drop 'buttons' carefully into boiling water for about 5 minutes. These dumplings float when they are done cooking. Drain.\n\n** I a large saucepan, melt some butter; add buttons, making sure to have only one layer. Brown lightly on both sides. \n\n**Melissa found an alternate recipe online called \"vareniki\" or \"varenyky\" which is a Ukrainian word meaning \"boiled thing\" and refers to a type of dumpling.  The recipe calls for 3 eggs, 16 oz of dry cottage cheese (or ricotta cheese), 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 tablespoon salt, 1 1/2 cups flour.  Beat 3 eggs in a bowl until light and fluffy.  Add dry cottage cheese.  Add sugar and salt; mix.  Slowly add flour until dough is workable.  Roll out and cut into 1\" pieces.  Put in boiling water and let water come to a boil again.
