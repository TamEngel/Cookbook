    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWash 3-4 large peaches and chop them into bite sized pieces or slices (you'll need about 2 and a half cups of chopped or thinly sliced peaches to cover the cake.). Set them aside in a bowl while you prepare the cake batter.\n\nAdd the butter and the sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and beat them together until the mixture is fluffy and becomes a pale colour (about 4-5 minutes). It's important that the butter is at room temperature before you begin. This will allow it to integrate properly with the other wet ingredients.\nFeel free to use a hand mixer if you prefer.\n\nAdd the eggs and the vanilla and beat them in on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the bowl periodically to make sure everything is incorporated evenly.\n\nAdd the milk and sour cream and beat in these ingredients on low speed until they're combined.\n\nTo a separate bowl add the flour, the baking powder and the salt and mix these ingredients together with a fork or a wire whisk. Once they're all incorporated, dump the flour mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer with the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and watch the batter come together. As soon as you see the batter form with streaks of flour throughout, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.\n\nOver-mixing at this stage can cause an overly dense and dry cake with large air bubbles, which you definitely don't want. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl by hand and gently fold in the remaining flour. Be sure to stop folding as soon as everything is combined.\n\nGrease a 9x13 rectangular glass cake pan (or a metal pan) with some butter and pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to push the batter into the corners and even out the surface. Don't worry, the batter will seem thick but it's supposed to be like that.\n\nSpread the peaches over the top of the batter.\n\nIn a clean bowl mix together the flour, sugar and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Add in the melted butter and mix everything together with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n\nSprinkle the streusel mixture over the cake and the peaches, making sure to spread it at evenly as possible and into all the corners.\n\nBake the cake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 47-50 minutes. When it's finished baking the topping will be slightly browned on top, the fruit will be bubbly, and when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake it will come out clean.\n\nLet the cake cool for at least 25 minutes before slicing."

    "recipeText": "Preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nWash 3-4 large peaches and chop them into bite sized pieces or slices (you'll need about 2 and a half cups of chopped or thinly sliced peaches to cover the cake.). Set them aside in a bowl while you prepare the cake batter.\n\nAdd the butter and the sugar to the bowl of your stand mixer and beat them together until the mixture is fluffy and becomes a pale colour (about 4-5 minutes). It's important that the butter is at room temperature before you begin. This will allow it to integrate properly with the other wet ingredients.\nFeel free to use a hand mixer if you prefer.\n\nAdd the eggs and the vanilla and beat them in on medium speed until the mixture is smooth. It's a good idea to scrape down the bowl periodically to make sure everything is incorporated evenly.\n\nAdd the milk and sour cream and beat in these ingredients on low speed until they're combined.\n\nTo a separate bowl add the flour, the baking powder and the salt and mix these ingredients together with a fork or a wire whisk. Once they're all incorporated, dump the flour mixture into the bowl of the stand mixer with the wet ingredients. Turn the mixer on low and watch the batter come together. As soon as you see the batter form with streaks of flour throughout, turn off the mixer and remove the bowl.\n\nOver-mixing at this stage can cause an overly dense and dry cake with large air bubbles, which you definitely don't want. Using a rubber spatula, scrape down the sides of the bowl by hand and gently fold in the remaining flour. Be sure to stop folding as soon as everything is combined.\n\nGrease a 9x13 rectangular glass cake pan (or a metal pan) with some butter and pour the batter into the pan, using the spatula to push the batter into the corners and even out the surface. Don't worry, the batter will seem thick but it's supposed to be like that.\n\nSpread the peaches over the top of the batter.\n\nIn a clean bowl mix together the flour, sugar and cinnamon for the streusel topping. Add in the melted butter and mix everything together with a fork until the mixture becomes crumbly.\n\nSprinkle the streusel mixture over the cake and the peaches, making sure to spread it at evenly as possible and into all the corners.\n\nBake the cake at 350 degrees Fahrenheit for 47-50 minutes. When it's finished baking the topping will be slightly browned on top, the fruit will be bubbly, and when you insert a toothpick into the center of the cake it will come out clean.\n\nLet the cake cool for at least 25 minutes before slicing."

    "recipeText": "In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and cardamom together. \n\nCut the butter into the flour using a pastry blender, 2 knives, or your fingertips. The mixture should look like coarse crumbs. Gently fold in the pears.\n\nWhisk the vanilla and buttermilk together and gradually add it to the flour mixture. Stir just until the dough comes together. You may not need all the buttermilk. Add a little at a time until the mixture is moist but not too wet. Do not over mix the dough or the scones will be tough.\n\nTransfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead the dough four or five times. Pat the dough into a 7-inch round circle.\n\nCut the circle in half, then cut each half into four triangle-shaped wedges. Arrange the scones 2 inches apart on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Place the scones in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n\nPosition the oven rack in the center of the oven and heat to 400 degrees F. Brush the tops of the scones with cream. \nBake for 15 to 20 minutes or until golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool and drizzle with glaze. Scones are best enjoyed right away.\n\n\n\nNotes\nDon't add all the liquid at once. Depending on the humidity and the brand of flour you are using, you may need less liquid than what is called for. Add just enough to moisten the dry ingredients until they hold together when squeezed.\n\nDice the pear into small pieces. Smaller pieces will make it easier to cut the dough into triangles.\n\nMake sure butter and milk are cold when adding it to the recipe.\n\nFreeze the shaped scones for 30 minutes before baking. This helps the scones keep their shape and ensures the butter isn't too warm before going into the oven.\n\nThis recipe yields 8 large scones. For smaller scones, cut the dough into 16 pieces instead of 8. Watch the scones closely as they bake because smaller scones may require a shorter baking time.\n\nMake Ahead Tip\nYou can refrigerate the dough overnight then simply shape the scones and bake them the next day.\nThe dough can also be frozen for up to 2 months. Freeze the dough on a baking sheet as directed in step 5 then wrap in plastic wrap and store in a freezer bag. When ready to make the scones, preheat the oven and baked as directed. There's no need to thaw the dough.\nYou can keep leftover scones for up to 2 days in the refrigerator.\nUnglazed scones can be frozen for up to three months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight then reheat and glaze before serving.\n\nButtermilk is a favored product in high altitude baking because it contribute acidity as well as richness, moisture, flavor, and tenderness. If a sea-level recipe calls for regular milk, you can replace it with buttermilk. Acidity weakens the elasticity and/or strength of gluten in wheat flour, thereby keeping baked products tender."

Allow the scones to cool right on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool completely.\n\n\nMake the White Glaze:\nIn a small mixing bowl, combine the powdered sugar and 2 tablespoons of the heavy cream until there are no lumps. The glaze should be on the thicker side but still pourable; you can add in a little more heavy cream if it's too thick.\nSpoon the glaze over the surface of each scone and allow the glaze to set for about 15 to 20 minutes.\n\n\nMake the Pumpkin Glaze:\nIn a small mixing bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar and pumpkin pie spice.

Drizzle the glaze back and forward over the scones. Allow the glaze to set for at least 15 minutes until it sets.\n\n\nNOTE: Make sure the glaze sets/dries completely before applying the next.

    "recipeName": "Freeze Basil Leaves",
    "recipeDescription": "",
    "servingSize": "",
    "ingredientList": "",
    "recipeText": "If you stick a bunch of basil leaves in the freezer without any preparation, those leaves are going to turn brown and mushy as soon as you pull them out. Basically, the freezer pauses the decomposition process, but then it fast forwards the minute those leaves feel warm air again.\nIt is possible to freeze basil leaves without them getting all nasty. It just takes a little prep work. \n\nYou can blanch them, mix them with oil, or make basil pesto. Then you freeze. All of these methods are fast and easy. They require just 10 to 20 minutes of your time and a couple supplies.\nLet's look at each of these methods.\n\n\nBlanch Basil Leaves\nThe blanching process kills off the microorganisms that cause decomposition. It's the best way to ensure leaves from your garden retain both their nice green color and flavor after being frozen.\n\nHOW TO BLANCH BASIL LEAVES\nFill a large bowl with ice water. Bring a large pot of water to boil.\n\nDip your basil stems into the boiling water for a few seconds. Your goal is not to cook the leaves (that'll get rid of some of the flavor)—just to wilt them.\n\nDunk the stems in the ice water immediately after to stop the cooking process.\n\nOnce your leaves are blanched, you just have to pat them dry with a towel and then strip them from the stems. Transfer the leaves to a freezer-safe bag (avoid bunching the leaves up in the bag) and place in the freezer.\n\nNow you have frozen basil leaves ready to add to the very end of your cooking time when you're making pasta or pizza!\n\n\nPreserve Basil in Olive Oil\nOlive oil is a wonderful preservative because it prevents the growth of those microorganisms that cause decay. To preserve your basil leaves in olive oil, you just need a high-quality olive oil (I recommend extra virgin olive oil) and an ice cube tray.\n\nHOW TO MAKE FROZEN BASIL CUBES\nI recommend blanching the basil leaves first, but it's optional. Make sure to at least wash your leaves and then pat them dry with a kitchen towel.\n\nStrip the leaves from the stems. My trick is to hold the top part of a stem and rub my hands downward. This method works for herbs like basil, thyme, and oregano, and the thicker the stem, the easier it is to pull those leaves off quickly.\n\nChop the basil leaves into small pieces. Cutting releases the oils and the flavor and also makes it easier to save your herbs. Your pieces don't need to be precise. Saving the flavor of summer is what matters here, not making it look pretty.\n\nStuff as much basil as you can into each little cube.\n\nFill each cube to the top with olive oil (or at least make sure all the leaves are covered so they'll freeze). Again, the goal is not to look pretty. The goal is flavor, and that you shall have.\n\nStick your tray in the freezer.\n\nOnce the cubes are frozen, pop them out and store them in a freezer-safe baggie, Tupperware, or jar.\n\nWhenever you're craving basil, all you have to do is open your freezer, pull out a cube, and toss it in a pan to melt on the stove. Boom! You'll be transported to summer, and your dish will taste so fresh and gourmet.\nToss you basil cubes on pasta, grilled or baked chicken, tomato soup—any cooked dish that calls for basil. Your kitchen will smell like you're in the middle of July, even though it's January.\n\nTIP:\nThis method also works well with other soft herbs like cilantro, parsley, dill, and even chives.\n\n\nFreeze Basil Pesto\nPesto freezes really well thanks to the olive oil inside. If you have a couple basil plants, you can easily make enough pesto to last you all winter long.\n\nHOW TO FREEZE BASIL PESTO\nBlanch your basil leaves to preserve the green color. Otherwise, wash your leaves and pat them dry.\n\nUse a food processor to whip up your favorite pesto recipe. I toss about 3 cups basil leaves in with roasted pine nuts or almonds, a couple garlic cloves, grated parmesan cheese, olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Blitz the ingredients in a food processor until you have a spreadable paste.\n\nSpread your pesto into an ice cube tray (or a nonstick muffin pan, if you'd like larger servings).\n\nStick your tray in the freezer.\n\nOnce the pesto cubes are frozen, pop them out and store them in a freezer-safe baggie, Tupperware, or jar.\n\nPull a cube out and melt it over warm pasta for a cozy meal on a cold night. If you're feeling adventurous, add your pesto to pizza, grilled vegetables, or even egg-based dishes for breakfast.\n\n"

Broccoli is packed with fiber, vitamin A, and vitamin C.\n\nCauliflower.\n\nBrussels Sprouts.\n\nVegetable, Canola, or Olive Oil\n\nSeasonings – see below.",
    "recipeText": "ROASTING THE VEGETABLES\n\n• Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.\n\n• If needed, coat baking sheet with non-stick spray. If using a good pan, this is not necessary.\n\n• Place cut vegetables in a great big bowl or zip-top bag.\n\n• Top with oil and sprinkle with seasoning. Toss to coat.\n\n• Pay special attention to the broccoli florets and make sure they get an adequate amount of oil, as they are more prone to burning.\n\n• Spread the vegetables into a single layer with a bit of space. Divide the vegetables evenly between two sheets if needed.\n\n• Roast the vegetables at 400 degrees F. for 25 minutes.\n\n• Toss the vegetables halfway through.\n\n• Enjoy hot or at room temperature, with additional salt and pepper to taste.\n\n\nSEASONINGS\n• Cavender’s Greek Seasoning\n• Tony Chachere’s Creole Seasoning\n• Garlic - salt, pepper, and garlic powder (or minced garlic).\n• Italian Seasoning\n• Rosemary\n• Dijon Mustard\n• Parmesan. A finishing sprinkle of Parmesan cheese.\n• Spicy - Season with 1/2 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (more if you like super spicy!), or regular chili powder plus cayenne.\n• Cheesy - Sprinkle with freshly grated cheddar, mozzarella, gruyere, or Parmesan cheese. Add after roasting. Pop back into the oven for a few minutes to melt.\n• Citrus - Add thin lemon slices or orange slices to the pan. Finish with a squeeze of fresh lemon juice or orange juice.\n• Pesto - Reduce the olive oil. Toss the vegetables in store-bought or homemade pesto.\n• Honey - 1 tablespoon honey and an extra pinch of salt. Line your baking sheet with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Curry - Season with curry powder and a touch of cumin.\n• Balsamic - 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar prior to roasting. Line the pan with foil or parchment paper for easy clean up.\n• Mediterranean - Season with oregano and a touch of red wine vinegar. Add sliced olives to the pan. Sprinkle with feta cheese and top with a squeeze of lemon juice prior to serving.\n\nCUTTING VEGETABLES FOR ROASTING\nIf you are mixing different vegetables on the pan, you will want to make sure they finish cooking in the same amount of time. Here are some tips:\n\n• Round Root Vegetables (Beets, Sweet Potatoes, Potatoes). Cut these vegetables on the smaller size (about 3/4-inch pieces), as they tend to take longer to roast.\n\n• Long Root Vegetables (Carrots, Parsnips). Similarly, these veggies take longer to roast. Cut any thick ones in half lengthwise, then cut them crosswise into 1 1/2-inch slices.\n\n• Cruciferous Vegetables (Brussels Sprouts, Cauliflower, Broccoli). Cut Brussels sprouts in half, and remove the stems. Cut broccoli and cauliflower stems into small rectangular pieces, and slice florets into pieces that are about 1/2- to 3/4-inch thick and 1 1/2- to 2-inches wide.\n\n• Soft Vegetables (Green Beans, Asparagus). These veggies roast quickly, so you can leave them as is (discard the ends of the green beans and woody stems of the asparagus)\n\n• Bell Peppers (Green, Red, Yellow, Orange). Core the peppers and cut into 3/4-inch pieces or 1/2-inch strips.\n\n• Onions (Red, Yellow, or Sweet). Cut off the stem end, then remove the paper and waxy layers. Cut off the root end, then slice the onion in half from end to end. Cut each half lengthwise into about 4 wedges.\n\n• Cherry Tomatoes (or Grape Tomatoes). Leave whole. Line your baking sheet with parchment paper, as the yummy juices will become sticky and caramelize.\n\nTO STORE: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight storage container for up to 5 days.\nTO REHEAT: Rewarm vegetables on a baking sheet in the oven at 350 degrees F or in the microwave.\nTO FREEZE: Freeze leftovers in an airtight freezer-safe storage container for up to 3 months. Reheat from frozen. Once reheated, frozen roasted vegetables may be a bit soggy, but they will still have great flavor.\n"

Rinse the outside of the cloth, squeeze again, then open the cloth to get the cottage cheese out. \n\n** Other recipes say you can use a full egg in the cottage cheese mix. Use 3/4 to 1 cup of cottage cheese, 3 TBSP sugar, and 1/4 tsp of cinnamon.\n\n** Some recipes suggest 1/2 tsp. baking powder.\n\n** Drop 'buttons' carefully into boiling water for about 5 minutes. These dumplings float when they are done cooking. Drain.\n\n** I a large saucepan, melt some butter; add buttons, making sure to have only one layer. Brown lightly on both sides. \n\n**Melissa found an alternate recipe online called \"vareniki\" or \"varenyky\" which is a Ukrainian word meaning \"boiled thing\" and refers to a type of dumpling.
